# Dodger
This serves as my Final Project for the ECE241 Course at the University of Toronto.

Introducing Dodger, a meticulously crafted, fully animated game developed entirely from scratch using Verilog. It embodies a retro-style platformer game where players navigate by dodging randomly falling objects, controlled with the left and right arrow keys. Successfully dodging objects earns players a point, and the game concludes upon collision. As time progresses, the game's difficulty intensifies, with objects falling at increasingly faster rates. The high score is then securely stored.


Key Features of the Game:

- Player control facilitated through PS2 keyboard input
- Immersive sound effects delivered through speakers
- Real-time display of the player's current score on a HEX display, along with the all-time high score
- Efficient utilization of SDRAM Memory to store and retrieve Title Screens, High Scores, Audio Files, etc.
- Seamless operations ensured through Clock-Crossing techniques

I hope you enjoy! (FYI, I recieved a perfect mark for the project!)
